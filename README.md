# Currently the bot can do the following thigs:
- Automatically reply to people asking for farms
- Automatically reply to certain expression (Ie: "Is litematica updated")
- Automatically replies to videos from certain channel. It needs more prompts and the prompts need better formating
- Replies in the thread if a tag is added  
- Sends and pins a checklist in a new thread (Advisors+ to edit it)
- Backs up the archive. This is still a WIP

# The bot has the following commands:
  - /Prompt <prompt_name>: This lets you pick from a list of prompts and it will send it in the channel
